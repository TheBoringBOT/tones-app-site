        <h2>Anonymous Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
          While we do not store personal information, we track anonymous events within the app to improve user experience and functionality. These events are collected without any personally identifiable information and help us understand how users interact with the app.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Audio Start and Finish:</strong> We track when audio sessions are started and finished, including the preset ID and session duration.</li>
          <li><strong>Favorite Preset:</strong> We track when a user favorites or unfavorites a preset.</li>
          <li><strong>Mixer Modifications:</strong> We track changes to the audio mixer, such as volume adjustments, reverb settings, tone volume, noise volume, and equalizer type changes.</li>

          <li><strong>Preferred Timer Usage:</strong> We track when a user selects or uses a preferred timer duration.</li>
          <li><strong>Refocus Sounds:</strong> We track when users select, start, or end refocus sounds, and the chosen refocus sound. We also track changes to refocus sound intervals.</li>
